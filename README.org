#+TITLE: codel.el: some llm tools
#+author: Paul D. Nelson
* Overview
=codel= (pronounced like the verb "coddle", a synonym of "pamper") is a a collection of llm tools for use with emacs.

This repository is intended as a way for me to share tools I'm experimenting with.  Eventually (when I have the time and the tools reach a sufficient level of polish), I intend to PR them to https://github.com/skissue/llm-tool-collection.

* Background on tool use in Emacs

* Setup

You'll need some Emacs package for working with LLM's that supports tool use.  [[https://github.com/karthink/gptel][gptel]] is a popular option.  I mostly use my personal package [[https://github.com/ultronozm/ai-org-chat.el][ai-org-chat]], which supports tool use via the [[https://github.com/ahyatt/llm][llm]] library.

If you're using =gptel=, then you can register the tools provided by this package via =M-x codel-setup=gptel=.

With =ai-org-chat=, use =M-x codel-setup-ai-org-chat=.
